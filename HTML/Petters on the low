Am I wrong cuz I wanna get it on till I die

Am I wrong cuz I wanna get a jeaun till I die

Get a beaun till I die, get a seaun till I die

Man, y'all remember me, I'm the biggest nig alive


Ever since I started petting, all the bad men betting

On a dunk ass nigga with no reason or rhyme

But ever since I broke the bank, I spent the proceeds all on cake

And now a fatass piggy gotta flee from the crime


Pet me, pet you, that's the mission we pursue

If the job is done correctly, then they paying what is due

But when the bitches start trippin', when I know my game is slippin'

Imma keep on petting till they sippin' below


You a fucking crow, you a stupid hoe

You are just a doe, man we petters on the low


Food is my appeal for a turk, that's quite a deal

Y'all remember me, I was the adult eating Happy Meals

Chickens in the desert got sand on the feathers

Damn, I don't give a hell

I have no taste, man I like Kazaam


Slam me, but never ask me to give a damn

Am I wrong cuz I fucking ate it all with my hands (yeah!)

Even on a diet you can still eat a fucking bomb

Old ass nigga from the trailer, "you can't change john"


Snake me, forsake me

Corn flake me, burnt steak me

Milkshake me, unmake me 

In the wild wild west

You can break me but never risk me a stomach ache

If I'm hungry you better bake me a fucking cake
